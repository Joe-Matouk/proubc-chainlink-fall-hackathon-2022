## About
Decentralized Price Feeds for SAP S/4 HANA - powered by Chainlink, proUBC, and PRVD

This hackathon entry uses Chainlink price feeds in a novel, totally off-chain/Web 2.0 context: the SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system

Fortune 500-level organizations use SAP S/4 HANA to manage their corporate finance, supply chain, and other business processes. In this context, reliable foreign exchange rate data for cross-border B2B finance is incredibly important. Further - up to this point crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink have seldom ever before been defined as currencies in SAP S/4 HANA. This hackathon entry assumes a corporation running S/4 HANA has a legal and managerial obligations to produce financial reporting in USD and wants to accurately capture forex and digital asset exchange rates in USD using Chainlink price feeds.

With reliable price updates for digital assets to S/4 HANA via Chainlink - Fortune 500 enterprises using SAP S/4 HANA can also confidently proceed with Web3 business strategies that rely upon use of BTC, ETH, MATIC, LINK or other digital assets for on-chain finance and smart contract integration to B2B processes.
